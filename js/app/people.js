            bio: "Robert Bruce was an anthropologist and linguist who dedicated his accomplished academic career to studying the Lacandon people. He attended the University of Oklahoma in the late 1950s, where he began his anthropological study of the Lacandon. He was attracted to the Lacandon because they were one of the few Mayan groups that still practiced the indigenous Maya religion. In 1957 he was introduced to Chan K'in Viejo, the community leader of the Lacandon. Chan K'in Viejo taught Robert Bruce the Lacandon language, sparking a friendship that lasted four decades. Robert was especially interested in Lacandon religious practices and dream interpretation. In addition to his anthropological and linguistic studies at the University of Oklahoma and later at the National Institute of Anthropology and History in Mexico City, he also spent significant amounts of time living among the Lacandon, adopting the traditional clothing, hair and general lifestyle (Borhegyi 1965; Bruce and Perera 1982:2-4; Maykuth 1994; Hach Winik 2005).",
